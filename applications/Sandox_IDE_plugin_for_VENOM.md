## Project Information
- Project Name: Sandox IDE
- Project Short Description:  
Sandox is an integrated development environment, that is designed to give web3 ecosystem developers new convenient tools for multi chain dApps development that leverage existing capabilities by combining development, deployment and debugging tools for multiple chains in one place - a convenient sandbox ensuring a low barrier to entry for dApps developers. To run the code, developers won't need to set up a project, download and compile all libraries locally. The code written in the Sandox web editor is compiled and executed directly in a browser.  
In this entire proposal we offer to add to Sandox IDE support for TVM and develop a Sandox VENOM plug-in with T-Sol syntax support and a one-click-run-and-deploy service for smart contracts. A "VENOM network" panel will also be developed, that will allow to choose between chains and provide an API for other modules/plug-ins to connect to the chosen network.  
Additionally, under this grant we propose to integrate the `everscale-inpage-provider` and `everscale-standalone-client` libraries so that developers will be able to write JavaScript code that interacts with the Venom Network.

## Problem / Solution
Most ecosystems nowadays feel the effects of the bear market and decrease in user interest along with the increase in the number of ecosystems that was driven by the previous stage of market growth. The additional complexity (which means “costs”) for developer teams arising from building projects in less adopted or multiple networks is the amount of efforts they need to spend to build and interconnect a number of tools and concepts that they should be aware of. For some teams these are the arguments to turn their attention towards the most mature networks to gain exposure to their capital and users to the detriment of any advantages that the project could gain deployed in less adopted, but unique in tech, networks.
Developers always strive to put less effort into the environment and set the core focus on the dApp experience. While the logical solution should lie in reducing the number of “things that exist” in the developers’ environment, this won’t work as each ecosystem do have its tools and libraries to provide access to its unique features.
Sandox is thought to solve this complexity and drive the adoption of multiple networks not by adding more tools, but by “encapsulating” this wide range of tools and libraries and providing the appropriate APIs.
